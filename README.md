### Question Answering

This code implements Dynamic Coattention Networks. Currently it works with GradientDescentOptimizer only. 
There are some issues with AdamOptimizer and AdagradOptimizer which I am working on.

You can run the code by command -

python train.py --data_dir "[path]/data/squad/"

This is a part of assignment 4 of Stanford course CS224n. Some part of code was already given as a start point.
